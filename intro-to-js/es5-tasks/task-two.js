// Given the array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], perform the following operations:

// Use forEach to log each number prefixed by "Number: ".
// Use map to create a new array where each number is doubled.
// Use filter to return only numbers greater than 25.
// Use reduce to sum all numbers in the array.
// Use every to check if all numbers are greater than 5.
// Use some to check if any number is less than 20.
